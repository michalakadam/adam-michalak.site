# Turning effort into the reward
*Sustainable productivity system*

Managing the molecule that fuels motivation - dopamine - is the key to boosting personal productivity, increasing life satisfaction and protecting mental well-being. My journey with conscious dopamine management started in 2022, after hearing Andrew Huberman explain the pain/pleasure balance. Over time, I built a whole system that supports turning effort into the reward, not the excuse. Below is my recipe for maintaining a healthy relationship with dopamine so that pleasure remains a choice, not an autopilot program. This system makes motivation steadier, work feel less brittle, and pleasure less self-sabotaging.

## Dopamine baseline, spikes and crashes

Let's start with the mental model: think of dopamine as your motivational fuel. Your baseline is the steady level that sets how motivated and clear you feel day-to-day. Spikes are quick surges (from novelty, sugar, social media, etc.) that feel great in the moment. The catch is the crash: after every spike, levels dip below baseline while receptors reset. Stack a few spikes and your baseline can drift lower, leaving you flat, distractible, and craving more hits.

The good news is that we can control not only the spike / crash cycle but also the baseline level. Things like quality [sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39127232/), [exercise](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301978), [cold exposure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9953392), [mindfulness](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11591838/), [effort](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/10/pgae432/7828923) and [adequate levels of light exposure](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384573367_Bright_Light_Therapy_for_Nonseasonal_Depressive_Disorders_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis) ([especially after waking up](https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/using-light-for-health)) are scientifically proven to increase dopamine baseline over time.

## Link effort to reward
Andrew Huberman popularized the pain/pleasure balance metaphor—one of several ways researchers frame dopamine’s role. "If you experience pain and you continue to be in that friction and exert effort, the rewards are that much greater when they arrive. Pain evokes dopamine after the pain is over." The goal is not to spike dopamine before or right after hard work; the goal is to draw motivation from the effort itself and turn the pursuit into the reward.

To put it into practice, choose the next concrete step, do it, and mentally mark it done. Each small completion gives just enough dopamine to keep going. When friction peaks, use a short cue - “hard now, rewarding later” - or Huberman’s script: “This is very painful… Because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later. I am doing it by choice and because I love it.” Over time, by following this protocol, enjoyment shifts from the outcome to the act of working.

## Timing is key
However, it works only when your dopamine system isn’t numbed by constant high-dopamine hits. No amount of willpower will make the mind focus hard on a task and feel good about grinding if the dopamine receptors are saturated. Spiking dopamine before or right after work, repeatedly, is a recipe for an unproductive day and eventual burnout.

What works best for me is minimizing dopamine spikes during the day and consuming pleasures in the evening when my kid is in bed and I have no more work to do. This way, I can enjoy the pleasures fully - without impacting my creative output and the resulting satisfaction of a productive day. With distractions out of the way, it's easier to focus on what requires effort and is important. I still binge-watch YouTube, scroll Reddit, and play video games—but I do it at the right time, in a sustainable way.

## Rule your tech, or it will rule you
Easier said than done! The biggest challenge in implementing a friction-to-reward system is the countless dopamine traps that our autopilots lead us into. To avoid falling into them, [we cannot rely on self-control](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-control-yourself/). Instead, we need to set up our environment in a way that will protect us from sources of easy dopamine spikes. As [Matt Might brilliantly put it](https://matt.might.net/articles/cripple-your-technology/), we need to mold our environment so "that the path of least resistance will be the path of maximum productivity." Because most of our tools are optimized for engagement, the best defense is to cripple the everyday tech that competes for attention:
* Turning smartphone into a dumbphone - no distracting apps, no colors, no flashy app icons (check out [Olauncher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher&hl=en)). The most exciting thing I can do with my phone is check the weather and the status of incoming InPost parcels.
* Blocking all of the distracting websites - on every device - during work and family hours using dedicated software. I use [StayFree](https://stayfreeapps.com/).
* Keeping the phone far away so that it requires effort to reach.

This is in line with [Digital Minimalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism) which is "a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else."

## Success does not happen overnight

If you would like to set up a system for dopamine control in your life, know that it's an iterative process that takes time to settle into. Failure is an inevitable part of it. The goal is to be 0.1% better every day.
